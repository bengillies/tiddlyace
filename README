TiddlyACE integrates TiddlySpace with the Ace IDE (https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace)

The intention is that this will aid development of SPAs within TiddlySpace and
encourage development directly within TiddlySpace itself, cutting out the
deployment step.

The work pattern then becomes:

	1) code
	2) refresh browser (test)
	3) that's it. It's live already.

Please feel free to fork and send in pull requests, as there's still quite a
lot to do.
